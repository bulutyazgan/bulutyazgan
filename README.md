## b.

I enjoy `2D game development` and `cybersecurity (malware development and networking)`. Currently working on `machine learning` and `artificial intelligence`.

```python
class Me:
  def __init__(self):
    self.languages = ['python', 'Java']
    self.libraries = ['pygame', 'socket', 'numpy', 'tensorflow', 'pytorch']
```
